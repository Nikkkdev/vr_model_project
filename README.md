The first university in Kazakhstan projected in virtual reality.
Our motivation to work on a project about a VR 3D model of a university is to utilize our skills in 3D modeling, VR technology, and animation to create an immersive and interactive experience for users. This project would allow users to explore the university in a virtual environment, providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the campus layout, facilities, and amenities. Additionally, it can be an innovative way to showcase the university and attract prospective students, faculty, and staff. Creating an interactive 3D model of the university can also be used for virtual tours and other promotional materials for the university. Furthermore, it can also be used by current students, faculty, and staff for orientation and planning purposes, increasing the convenience and accessibility of information about the university.
